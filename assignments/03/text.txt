1. Give a short overall explanation in your own words of what you did in this assignment (max. 200 words). (5 Points)
- deployment of OpenStack to GCP 
- 3 GCP VMs: one as OpenStack controller, 2 as compute instances 
- by using OpenStack one cab start a vm on one of the 2 compute instances
- deployment was done by kolla-ansible which deployed and set up docker containers to controller and compute vms
- configuration of virtual networks (for GCP and OpenStack)
- Fix a common bug in /etc/hosts: removes duplicate entries which may lead to RabbitMQ issues


2. You created gc VMs, deployed OpenStack and started an OpenStack VM. Imaging a hypothetical REST API call from an OpenStack VM1 to an OpenStack VM2 via the private network, whereupon VM2 downloads a file from the internet and sends it back to VM1. How many virtual networks are involved? (2 Point)
- 2 GCP virtual networks (cc-network1, cc-network2) + 2 OpenStack virtual networks (external network, admin network)


3. Initially, the OpenStack VM was not reachable from the gc controller VM (step 11). Why? (2 Points)
- no floating ip address was assigned to the OpenStack vm and therefor the vm was only reachable from within the OpenStack admin network


4. Look into the iptables-magic.sh script. What is happening there? Describe every command with 1-2 sentences. (5 Points)
floating_subnet="10.122.0.0/24"
floating_gateway="10.122.0.1"

docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip a add $floating_gateway dev br-ex
docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip link set br-ex up
docker exec openvswitch_vswitchd ip link set dev br-ex mtu 1400  # Ensure correct ssh connection

ip r a "$floating_subnet" via $floating_gateway dev br-ex

iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ens4 -j MASQUERADE

iptables -A FORWARD -i ens4 -o br-ex -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i br-ex -o ens4 -j ACCEPT
